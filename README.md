# Papimetica

PlaceholderAPI expansion for the Cosmetica API.

This expansion will work out of the box with no config, just like a regular expansion, but it will create the config file cosmetica.yml inside the PlaceholderAPI directory in your plugins folder. You can use this file to modify how frequently the expansion should contact Cosmetica servers looking for updated player info.
If you want to enable the %cosmetica_active% placeholder you must also specify your server's IP address and port (even if you're using 25565). This needs to be the IP of whatever server players directly connect to, so if you use bungeecord or some kind of proxy, use the IP of that.
